# catGallery

This project will be a website which allows you to upload images, forming a kind of gallery. There will be two kinds of galleries, cats and NOT cats, which will automatically be sorted using some kind of computer vision technology (like OpenCV?). I aim to use ReactJs for the frontend, Django for backend, Postgres for the database and maybe Bootstrap React for making things look a bit nicer.
